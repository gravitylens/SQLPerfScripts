# SQLPerfScripts
Scripts for diagnosing performance problems on Microsoft SQL Server.  I created these scripts a looooong time ago, but they are still handy.  Most scripts where written for SQL2005 and should still work today, some will also work on older versions.  A few are specifically for SQL2000 because the 2005 version would not work.  Like a said, a looooong time ago.
